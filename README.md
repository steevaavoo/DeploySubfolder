# DeploySubfolder

## Goals

For now, simply working on the module and refining it, adding and testing features with a view to eventual rollout to the Gallery if it proves worthwhile.

A module to deploy a folder under every subfolder of a specified root folder.

1. Add comment-based help
2. Add manifest
